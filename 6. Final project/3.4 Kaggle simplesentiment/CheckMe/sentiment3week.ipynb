      "0: mine generally requires a charege every 48 hours or so and i don 't really talk on it that much .\n",
      "1: there is also a small covering for the lens , so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched .\n",
      "0: i 'm an advocate of nokia , but this phone and the following models ( 7610 ) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .\n",
      "0: i thought given all the \" 10 \" reviews about this camera that i would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey .\n",
      "0: this is definitely one of those products , especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit .\n",
      "1: 5 . check traffic411.com for la traffic on the 405 .\n",

      "1: the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad . \n",
      "0: what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off . \n",
      "0: the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me . \n",

      "0: 4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying . \n",
      "0: the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel . \n",
      "1: now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it ! \n",
      "0: i built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits .\n",
      "0: it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to . \n",
      "1: 3 band and you can just change the sim card in it to be able to use it in europe with another service provider .\n",
      "0: one caveat i have is that i understand the ipod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved .\n",
      "1: by no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it , just be able to put a cd in the computer and it tells you what to do .\n",

      "0: i am bored with the silver look . \n",
      "0: on occasion i 'm not able to connect to the phone with isync via bluetooth but i found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem .\n",
      "0: i will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture .\n",
      "1: the setup was a breeze , i had some reservations about a wireless network ( see my review for linksys wet11 ) but this item was on sale as well as the wet11 so i just had to splruge .\n",
      "1: i downloaded a trial version of computer associates ez firewall and antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again .\n",
      "0: i am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the \" sliding wrench \" which comes on the router .\n",
      "1: the lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don 't need to fuss with a lens cap .\n",
      "0: it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras . \n",
      "1: 3 ) joy stick for eazy navigation , 35mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff .\n",
      "0: this camera uses a lithium battery , i find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient ; because what if you are on vacation , where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there .\n",
      "0: this product is too fragile for normal use . \n",
      "0: it 's not the heaviest around ( i think porter-cable has that distinction ) , but i found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation .\n",
      "0: even the pdf manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with \" mac settings \" , etc .\n"
